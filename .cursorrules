# Email Handling Rules

## Email Account Configuration
The following email accounts are configured with MCP Gmail servers:
- arvinda.reddy@gmail.com (mcp_gmail-arvinda-reddy)
- arvinda.gillella@gmail.com (mcp_gmail-arvinda-gillella)
- firsts.lastn@gmail.com (mcp_gmail-firsts-lastn)

## Email Checking Protocol
When the user asks to check emails (for any of the configured accounts):

1. **Search for Unread Emails**
   - Use `gmail_search_emails` with `isUnread: true` and `label: INBOX`
   - Retrieve up to 50 emails initially

2. **Categorize and Summarize**
   - Analyze all unread emails
   - Categorize them into:
     * 🔴 **CRITICAL/URGENT**: Security alerts, login notifications, account issues
     * 🟡 **IMPORTANT**: Time-sensitive offers, important updates, news updates
     * 🟢 **INFORMATIONAL**: Newsletters, promotions, general content
   
3. **Provide Actionable Summary**
   - Highlight CRITICAL items first with specific action items
   - List IMPORTANT items with brief context
   - Summarize INFORMATIONAL items in aggregate
   - Include dates for context (recent vs older emails)

4. **Mark Emails as Read**
   - After presenting the summary, automatically mark ALL summarized emails as read
   - Use `gmail_mark_email` for each email ID
   - Confirm completion with a simple note
